## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create a simple circle using CSS, which I had to Google a bit to understand how to create such elements using plain CSS. I also learned create a simple, horizonal line out of CSS just messing with borders and understanding how the CSS box-sizing works. That was something I did not expect to work on when I first stated this project

I also learned a bit more about CSS Grid and how gaps work. It was a much easier way to display images that are in a grid style. 

### Continued development

In the future, I definitely want to work on structuring my projects better and looking at the bigger picture rather than focusing on the micro. That is someting that I want to continue to develop. I also want to cut out redudant code and will work to fix that in the future.
